Firstly, install UQLab :

1. Unzip the zip archive in a folder, say my_UQLab_folder
â€‹
2. Open MATLAB and select my_UQLab_folder/core as your working directory

3. Type uqlab_install 

Then, run the "main ML.m" file to obtain the ML model, and run the "main Opt with ML.m" file for the optimization results. 

Note that, variable x1 in  "main Opt with ML.m" file should be 2, 5, or 10, matching the corresponding results in the paper.
